    <p>Only those with a “compelling reason” will be allowed to travel between the two countries under new measures, even if they are fully vaccinated.

      From midnight on Saturday, leisure travel will be off the table – at present, double-jabbed British arrivals are allowed in for any purpose.
      
      The list of “compelling reasons” does not include “travel for tourist or professional reasons”, according to a statement issued by the French government.
      
      However, French citizens and their spouses, partners and children will still be able to return to France from the UK.
      
      Other exemptions include students enrolled in France; being in transit for less than 24 hours; and those travelling due to the death or terminal prognosis of a close family member (grandparent, parent, child or sibling).</p>
